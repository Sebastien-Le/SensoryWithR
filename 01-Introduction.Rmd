# Understanding the data from a product perspective
## Understanding the products from a chemical and physical point of view

In the following code, we first import the data with the **read.delim2** function, then we print the first rows with the **head** function ; finally we make a summary of the dataset with the **summary** function. All these steps are really important when you begin you analysis.

```{r}
salmon_car <- read.delim2("Salmon_characteristics.txt", 
header=TRUE, row.names=1, comment.char="#",dec=",")
head(salmon_car)
summary(salmon_car)
```
